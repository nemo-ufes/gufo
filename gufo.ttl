Intended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.

There are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation.

The 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, \"gufo\" is the Italian word for \"owl\".

For background information on the reference ontology on which this implementation is based, see:

Guizzardi et al. (2013) included a notion of \"brings-about\" that related events to a single (\"maximal\") situation, embodying all the effects of the event at the time it ends. This implementation of gufo:broughtAbout diverges from \"brings-about\" in that work because gufo:broughtAbout can be used to relate events to more than one gufo:Situation.

For example, \"ShipType\" gufo:categorizes \"Ship\". Instances of \"ShipType\" such as \"Supercarrier\" and \"Cargoship\" should be declared subclasses of \"Ship\". OWL 2 punning should be used to capture the two facets of \"Supercarrier\" and \"Cargoship\" in this example: (i) as instances of \"ShipType\", and (ii) as subclasses of \"Ship\".

The categorized type is termed the \"base type\" in the \"powertype pattern\" see Carvalho et al (2017), the higher-order type is often called the \"powertype\".

gufo:categorizes is the general (unspecific) form of categorization. See  gufo:partitions for a more specific form, in which instances of the categorized type are classified by exactly one instance of the higher-order type.

The domain is gufo:Type excluding gufo:AbstractIndividualType as well as gufo:ConcreteIndividualTypes because those types are first-order types (their instances are individuals). Only instances of gufo:Type representing higher-order types can categorize a base type.

For further details and formalization of \"categorization\", see Carvalho et al (2017) which combines UFO with MLT (a multi-level modeling theory).

Use this property only for quality values that are to be reified in the A-box and associated with a gufo:ConcreteIndividual. Otherwise, use the gufo:hasQualityValue data property and a literal to determine the quality value.

The full representation pattern for quality values involves first identifying a gufo:Quality that inheres in a concrete individual and then associating it with a reified quality value. For example, let us consider the color of Yves Klein's \"Blue Monochrome\" painting made in 1961 (MoMA's object with number 618.1967). In the full pattern, an instance of gufo:Quality that inheres in the physical object (the color of that painting) is associated with a gufo:QualityValue (say the triplet <0, 47, 167> for that painting) through gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue. The full pattern is recommended when different quality spaces are expected to be used for the same quality. For example, the color of that painting could also be associated with a quadruple <100, 72, 0, 35> representing the same color in a CMYK space.

When the full pattern is not required, gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue can also be used to directly associate a concrete individual (without identifying the quality) with a quality value."""@en ;

For example, \"AnimalSpecies\" gufo:partitions \"Animal\". Instances of \"AnimalSpecies\" such as \"Lion\", \"Hiena\" must be disjoint subclasses of \"Animal\". OWL 2 punning should be used to capture the two facets of \"Lion\" and \"Hiena\" in this example: (i) as instances of \"AnimalSpecies\", and (ii) as  subclasses of \"Animal\".

Note that the partitioned type (in the example \"Animal\") may or may not be declared to be a disjoint union of the explicitly enumerated subclasses (such as \"Lion\", \"Hiena\"). This is because other instances of the higher-order type (\"AnimalSpecies\") may exist that are not explicitly enumerated in the ontology.

The partitioned type is termed the \"base type\" in the \"powertype pattern\" see Carvalho et al (2017), the higher-order type is often called the \"powertype\".

For further details and formalization of \"partitioning\", see Carvalho et al (2017) which combines UFO with MLT (a multi-level modeling theory).

Note that, in this case, the airplanes are conceptualized as playing the role of \"member of a fleet\". If various roles for the parts of a fleet were envisioned (such as \"cargo airplane\", \"passenger airplane\"), then a fleet would be best understood as a gufo:FunctionalComplex.
